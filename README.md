# Flight Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing flight data. It includes data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis of flight-related information.

## Overview

This project aims to provide insights into flight data using Python. It includes various analyses and visualizations to better understand the dataset.
Exploring the Data
The initial part of the code explores the flight dataset, providing basic statistics and data overview.

## Exploring Flight Delays

In this section, we analyze flight delays and present the findings using various visualizations.
## Initial Exaimination of Data

- **Mean Delay:** We calculate the mean delay for all flights with delays, which is approximately 14.28 minutes.

- **Maximum and Minimum Delay:** The maximum delay observed in the dataset is a substantial 1560 minutes, while the minimum delay is 0 minutes.

- **Most Common Delay:** The most frequent delay duration is 10 minutes.

## First Class & Coach Prices Correlation

Here, we investigate the correlation between first-class and coach prices using a random subset of the data.

## Correlation Between Coach Prices & Perks

We examine the relationship between coach prices and in-flight perks, including inflight entertainment, inflight meal, and inflight Wi-Fi.
